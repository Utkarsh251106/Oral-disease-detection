## Overview
A deep learning model for detecting oral diseases using custom CNN architecture. The model is trained to classify different types of oral diseases from images with data augmentation techniques and class weight balancing to handle imbalanced datasets.

## Features
- Custom CNN architecture optimized for oral disease detection
- Data augmentation for improved model generalization
- Class weight balancing for handling imbalanced datasets
- Learning rate scheduling with exponential decay
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics and visualizations
- Built with TensorFlow/Keras
